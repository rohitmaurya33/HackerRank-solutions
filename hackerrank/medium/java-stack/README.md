## Problem

In computer science, a stack or LIFO (last in, first out) is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the last element that was added.(Wikipedia)


A string containing only parentheses is balanced if the following is true:
1. if it is an empty string
2. if A and B are correct, AB is correct,
3. if A is correct, (A) and {A} and [A] are also correct.


Examples of some correctly balanced strings are: "{}()",  "[{()}]",  "({()})" <br>

Examples of some unbalanced strings are: "{}(",  "({)}",  "[[",  "}{" etc.<br>

 
Given a string, determine if it is balanced or not. 




**Input Format**

There will be multiple lines in the input file, each having a single non-empty string. You should read input till end-of-file.

The part of the code that handles input operation is already provided in the editor.

**Output Format**

For each case, print 'true' if the string is balanced, 'false' otherwise.

```java

import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] argh) {

        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

        int n = in.nextInt();
        in.nextLine();

        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

            String name = in.nextLine();
            int phone = in.nextInt();
            in.nextLine();

            map.put(name, phone);
        }

        while (in.hasNext()) {

            String s = in.nextLine();

            if (map.containsKey(s)) {
                System.out.println(s + "=" + map.get(s));
            } 
            else {
                System.out.println("Not found");
            }
        }

        in.close();
    }
}

```
